Jenkins Shared Libraries are used for code reusability in Pipeline jobs.
Jenkins Shared Libraries is a collection of Groovy scripts shared between different Jenkins jobs.
Developers use shared libraries to avoid writing the same code from scratch for multiple projects.
This drastically cuts down time spent on coding and helps avoid duplicate code.
